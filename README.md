  ## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, you will develop another application, GoRestaurant, only this time the mobile version for the customer. Now you will practice what you have learned so far in React Native together with TypeScript, to create a small app for ordering food.

This will be an application that will connect to a Fake API, and display and filter API food dishes and allow the creation of new orders.
